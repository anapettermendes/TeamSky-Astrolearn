			<div> <p class="sun_headings">Did you know...</p> The sun is a hot ball of gas which glows and is the heart of the solar system. It is a star which its influence extends further than the orbits of Neptune and Pluto.<br> The sun along with the rest of the solar system were created by a huge cloud of rotating gas and dust which is called a solar nebula.<br> Once the nebula collapses, it is overwhelmed by <b>gravity</b> and skins even faster which causes it to flatten into a disk. Most of the materials within this are pulled to the center creating the Sun which then accounts for <b>99.8% mass</b> of the entire solar system.
			  </div>

			    <div> <p class="sun_headings">Temperatures </p> The average temperature at its core is around <b>27 million degrees Fahrenheit</b>. The surface temperature is <b>10,000 degrees Fahrenheit</b>.<br> The sun will be in its mature phase for 10 billion years. The nuclear fusion causes huge amounts of energy and this radiates towards the Sun’s surface and atmosphere. The energy moves from the core and bounces around for up to 1 billion years. It then moves to the convective zone which is the upper interior layer of the Sun. the temperature can then drop to around <b>3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit or lower</b>. Bubbles of hot plasma form lots of ionized atoms which move to the photosphere.

			  <div> <p class="sun_headings">Size and location </p> The diameter averages to <b>864,000 miles</b> and is around 109 times bigger that Earth.The Suns location is in the center of the solar system and Earth orbits it from <b>93 million away</b>.<br> The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system but is it just an average star compared to other stars.<br> A red giant is <b>700 times bigger</b> than the sun and 14,000 times brighter! New evidence shows our Sun is bigger than anticipated. A solar eclipse researcher created models of the Lunar eclipse and matched up the shadow of the Moon. When looking at photos, they found that Sun’s radius was not precise.

			  <div> <p class="sun_headings">How old? </p> The sun is <b>four and a half billion years old</b> and doesn’t have any rings. It is a star, however it is not the biggest Star in the Solar System like you might think!<br> Unfortunately, just like the stars, the sun will one day run out of energy. Scientists predict that the Sun is halfway through its life and will eventually get so big and engulf Mercury and Venus. It could also swallow Earth!<br> It may last another <b>6.5 billion years</b> before it becomes a white dwarf. To tell how old the sun is, moon rocks brought back from expeditions can give us a detailed timeframe.
			  </div>

			    <div> <p class="sun_headings">What is it made from? </p> Composition is Hydrogen and Helium which is held together by its own source of gravity. Its rotation period at equator takes around <b>27 days</b> and the rotation period at equator takes around 36 days.<br> As we know, the Sun was made from rotating cloud of gas which is a solar nebula. The mass of the Sun is held together by gravitational attraction which causes immense pressure and temperature.<br> There are six regions of the Sun; the core, the radiative zone, the convective zone, which is located in the interior, the visible surface known as the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona which is the outermost region.

			  <div> <p class="sun_headings"> What is the Sun's job? </p> Although its not the biggest star, it is one of the most important. It is the most powerful source that holds our Solar System together.<br> It provides <b>light, heat and allows life to be on Earth</b>. We can assume from what information we know already, the Sun itself is not a suitable for things to live with its hot mix of energetic gasses and plasma it would not be able to have living things surviving on it.<br> However, it makes living on Earth possible, it provides warmth, and the energy living organisms need to form the basic food chains. It also contributes to climate change another major factor.
			  </div>

			  <div> <p class="sun_headings">Yellow dwarf star </p> Although the size of the sun is large, it isn’t as big as some of the stars in our solar system. Yellow dwarf stars are considered medium size.<br> There is only around 10% of starts which are classed as yellow dwarf. The term <b>“yellow dwarf”</b> is intentional due to shine of this specific type of star.<br> As we know, the Sun outshines 90% of the stars within the Milky Way. The term “yellow” refers to a spectral class which in this case is a G0type main sequence. In actual fact, the Sun is a white dwarf and is the colour white, but because of the Earth’s atmosphere, it appears yellow.
			  </div>

			    <div> <p class="sun_headings"> The sun in the Solar system </p> <b>The magnetic field</b> of the sun spreads throughout the solar system through solar wind. The sun is the largest object within our solar system.<br> It keeps the smallest amounts of debris within its orbit. The connection between the Sun and Earth is what creates the <b>seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate and radiation belts</b>. The suns magnetic field spreads around the whole of the solar system through solar wind.<br> As the Sun is held together by its own form of gravity, you are unable to stand on it. As a result of the Sun’s energy, there would be no life on Earth without it.
